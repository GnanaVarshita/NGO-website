        The scope of NGO projects is vast, ranging from education and healthcare
        to environment conservation, human rights, womenâ€™s empowerment, and
        beyond. Regardless of the area of focus, every project shares a common
        thread: the desire to create positive impact and effect change at the
        grassroots level.
