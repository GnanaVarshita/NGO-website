        5 Ways To Protect Underprivileged Children From Malnutrition In India
      </h1>
      <p>
        Healthy food and access to basic healthcare are essential for a child's
        development at physical, mental, and cognitive levels. All children must
        receive basic nutrition on time, regularly and appropriately, to prevent
        long-term and, in some cases, irreversible harm to their health. This is
        why it is crucial to spread awareness on the importance of maintaining
        good health. After all, every 3rd child under 5 years of age in India is
        chronically undernourished (NFHS 4, 2016). This is a staggering number
        in a nation that is known to make path-breaking achievements in fields
        like technology and science. Children are the future of every nation and
        they deserve to be looked after in the best possible manner. There is a
        severe lack of regular, healthy, and nutritious meals that all children
        must receive every single day. But nearly 60% of children in India,
        under the age of 5, are anaemic (NFHS 4, 2015-2016). The deprivation
        leads to children becoming anaemic and underweight, thus making
        malnutrition in India an unresolved reality. These unfortunate
        statistics reflect that many children are in dire need of basic
        resources for their overall development, right from the time they are
        born. From regular check-ups to awareness among parents, children need
        resources like medical care for their well-being. As malnourishment
        leads to 69% of deaths amongst children below the age of 5 years in
        India (UNICEF, 2019), CRY works to ensure that children have access to
        high-quality healthcare support. In 2022-23, 89% of children in CRY
        project areas, under the age of 5 years, have been protected from
        malnutrition in India (only 17% of children in CRY project areas are
        underweight, as compared to 32% all India status as per NFHS 5). To
        lower India's infant mortality rate (IMR), child mortality rate (CMR),
        and maternal mortality rate (MMR), CRY, Indiaâ€™s most trusted NGO,
        focuses on health and nutrition initiatives to adopt a proactive and
        responsive strategy.
